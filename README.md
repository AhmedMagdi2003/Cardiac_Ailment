🩺 ECG Signal Classification Using Machine Learning
This project aims to classify different types of cardiac conditions using extracted ECG signal features and machine learning techniques.
It includes a full pipeline from exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature selection to model training, cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning, and deployment using Streamlit.
🚀 Key Features
📊 Feature Selection using correlation and visualizations (swarm plots, strip plots)
🤖 Modeling with Extra Trees Classifier for high accuracy (up to 99%)
✅ Cross-validation for performance validation
🔍 Evaluation with confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score
🌐 Streamlit App for user-friendly prediction using manual input or file upload
💾 Model Deployment using pickle for real-time predictions
